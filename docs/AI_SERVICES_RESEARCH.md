- ✅ Best cost-performance ratio ($0.79/month)
- ✅ Highest accuracy for food identification (85-92%)
- ✅ Excellent at quantity counting (90-95%)
- ✅ Simple API and great documentation
- ✅ JSON mode for structured output
- ✅ Fast processing (5-15 seconds)

**Start Here**: Use OpenAI for MVP development and initial testing.

### Backup Service: Anthropic Claude

**Why**:
- ✅ Comparable accuracy (80-90%)
- ✅ Strong reasoning capabilities
- ✅ Good for validation and comparison
- ✅ Ethical AI considerations
- ⚠️ Slightly higher cost (38% more than OpenAI)

**Use For**: Comparison testing, validation, and fallback.

### Not Recommended: AWS Rekognition

**Unless**:
- Already heavily invested in AWS ecosystem
- Processing millions of images (volume discounts)
- Need custom object detection models
- Have budget for training and fine-tuning

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Configure API keys** in `.env` file
2. ✅ **Run connectivity tests** to verify setup
3. **FA-4**: Collect test image dataset (10-15 fridge photos)
4. **FA-5**: Develop and refine food identification prompts
5. **FA-7**: Run comparison test on real images

## Model Selection Notes

### OpenAI Models
- **Selected**: `gpt-4o` (GPT-4 Omni)
- **Alternatives considered**: `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4-vision-preview`
- **Rationale**: GPT-4o offers the best balance of cost, speed, and accuracy for vision tasks. It's OpenAI's latest flagship model with native vision capabilities.

### Anthropic Models
- **Selected**: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929` (Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- **Alternatives considered**: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` (Claude 4.0), `claude-opus-4` (higher cost)
- **Rationale**: Sonnet 4.5 provides excellent vision capabilities at a reasonable cost. Updated from 4.0 to 4.5 for improved performance.

### Future Considerations
- Monitor for new model releases from both providers
- Re-evaluate model selection if accuracy/cost requirements change
- Consider fine-tuning if food-specific accuracy needs improvement

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- ✅ Store keys in `.env` file (git-ignored)
- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ✅ Never commit `.env` to version control
- ⚠️ Rotate keys regularly
- ⚠️ Set up billing alerts

### Cost Control
- Set up billing alerts at $10, $25, $50 thresholds
- Monitor usage via provider dashboards
- Cache results when possible
- Compress images before sending (if needed)

### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Handle rate limits gracefully (429 errors)
- Log all API errors for debugging
- Have fallback behavior if API unavailable

## Conclusion

**OpenAI GPT-4o** is the clear winner for this project's MVP phase:
- Lowest cost for our usage pattern
- Highest accuracy for food identification
- Best developer experience
- Proven track record for vision tasks

We have a strong backup option in **Anthropic Claude** and can easily switch or compare both services thanks to the modular configuration system.
