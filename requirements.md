# Food Automation Project - Requirements & Design
## Project Vision
**Goal**: Create a fully automated food inventory monitoring system that tracks what food you have, quantities, and freshness without requiring daily user input.
**Long-term Vision**: Expand to integrated shopping automation, meal planning, and food ordering, but start with concrete inventory monitoring to prove the concept.
## Core Requirements
### Inventory Data Tracking
- **Food Items**: Identify specific food products and ingredients
- **Quantities**: Count-based tracking (3 apples, 2 milk cartons, 1 jar peanut butter)
- **Entry Time**: Track when items entered the system for freshness monitoring
- **Leftovers**: Special handling for homemade food to prevent waste
### System Behavior
- **Fully Automatic**: No user notifications or required confirmations
- **Pull-Based**: User checks status when needed rather than receiving alerts
- **Non-Intrusive**: System works in background without disrupting daily routine
### Technical Philosophy
- **Start Simple**: Python script + JSON file + smartphone photos
- **Modular Design**: Enable parallel development of different components
- **Rebuild When Constrained**: Accept limitations of simple approach initially
- **Local First**: Begin with local storage, expand to cloud/remote access later
## Development Strategy
### Phase Prioritization
1. **AI Processing Pipeline** - Prove food identification and quantity counting works reliably
2. **Data Models & Storage** - Structure the system properly once AI shows promise 
3. **Camera Hardware System** - Automate capture only after core concept validated
### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Manual Photo Processing** while camera hardware ships
- **Data Model Design** can proceed once AI requirements are understood
- **Interface Development** can begin after data models exist
- **API Design** for future MCP server integration
### Development Pace
- **Hobby Pace**: Evenings and weekends development
- **Iterative Approach**: Focus on making each phase work well before advancing
- **Validation Focus**: Spend time proving concepts before heavy implementation
## Epic Breakdown
### Epic 1: AI Processing Pipeline
**Goal**: Prove that computer vision can reliably identify food items and count quantities from real fridge photos.
**Scope**:
- Food item identification using cloud AI services (OpenAI GPT-4V, Google Vision)
- Quantity counting for discrete items
- Leftover food detection and categorization
- Confidence scoring and error handling
- Manual photo processing workflow
**Success Criteria**:
- 80%+ accuracy on common food items in your actual fridge
- Reliable counting of discrete items (cans, bottles, packages)
- Can distinguish between new items and leftovers
- Processing time under 30 seconds per photo
**Out of Scope**:
- Automated photo capture
- Real-time processing
- Complex quantity estimation for non-discrete items
### Epic 2: Data Models & Storage
**Goal**: Design proper data structures and storage that can support current needs and future extensions.
**Scope**:
- Inventory data model (items, quantities, timestamps, locations)
- JSON file storage format
- Data persistence and update logic
- Query interfaces for current inventory state
- Change tracking and history
**Success Criteria**:
- Clean data model that supports all tracking requirements
- Reliable data persistence across program runs
- Simple query interface for inventory status
- Foundation for future API development
**Out of Scope**:
- Database optimization
- Multi-user support
- Cloud synchronization
- Complex querying
### Epic 3: Camera Hardware System
**Goal**: Automate photo capture using door-triggered WiFi cameras for hands-off operation.
**Scope**:
- ESP32-CAM setup and configuration
- Door sensor implementation (light sensor or magnetic switch)
- WiFi connectivity and image upload
- Power management for extended battery life
- Integration with existing AI processing pipeline
**Success Criteria**:
- Automatic photo capture when fridge door opens
- 6+ month battery life with door triggering
- Reliable WiFi connectivity from inside fridge
- Seamless integration with manual photo workflow
**Out of Scope**:
- Multiple camera angles
- Real-time streaming
- Professional mounting solutions
- NFC triggering (future enhancement)
## MVP Implementation Plan
### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create local development environment**
   - Python virtual environment
   - OpenAI API key setup
   - Basic project structure
2. **Manual photo workflow**
   - Take systematic fridge photos with smartphone
   - Upload to designated folder
   - Run AI analysis script
   - Review and tune results
3. **Basic data persistence**
   - Design JSON schema for inventory items
   - Implement read/write functions
   - Create simple status display
### Success Metrics
- **AI Accuracy**: >80% correct food identification on personal fridge photos
- **Usability**: Can check current inventory in <30 seconds
- **Reliability**: System runs without errors for extended periods
- **Development Velocity**: Steady progress on each epic with hobby development pace
## Future Extensions (Post-MVP)
### Planned Enhancements
- **MCP Server Integration**: Allow AI assistants to query inventory
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based inventory viewing and editing
- **NFC Manual Triggering**: On-demand photo capture via smartphone tap
- **Shopping Integration**: Connect to grocery ordering services
- **Meal Planning**: Recipe suggestions based on available ingredients
### Technical Debt Tolerance
- Accept simple solutions that may need rebuilding
- Focus on proving value before optimizing architecture
- Prioritize working software over perfect design
- Plan for periodic refactoring as understanding improves
## Architecture Principles
### Modularity
- **AI Processing**: Standalone module that can work with any photo source
- **Data Storage**: Abstract interface that can be swapped (JSON â†’ database)
- **Photo Capture**: Separate concern from analysis and storage
- **User Interface**: Optional layer that doesn't affect core functionality
### Extensibility
- **API-First Thinking**: Design data access for future programmatic use
- **Configuration-Driven**: Avoid hardcoding assumptions about deployment
- **Plugin Architecture**: Allow new food recognition models or storage backends
- **Event-Driven**: Enable future real-time features and integrations
This requirements document will evolve as we learn from implementation, but provides a solid foundation for the initial development sprints.
